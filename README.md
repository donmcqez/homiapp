## Why MVVM?
* MVVM is one of the architectural patterns which enhances separation of concerns.
* Google introduced architecture components which includes **LiveData** and **ViewModel** which facilitates developing Android app using MVVM pattern.
* It's helpful to solve common problems like **Tight Coupling** and **Testability**.


### Used Jetpack Architecture Components
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Notify views when underlying sharedpreferences changes.
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
*

## Why Data Sources?
* Provides data from multiple sources (DB, API).
* Easily adding new data sources.

## Why Data Repository?
* Decouples the application from the data sources.
* Provides **single source of truth**
* Testable business logic via Unit Tests.

## Why Interactors(use-cases)?
* Sits between [Repository] and [ViewModel] for separation of responsibility 
* Each use-case performs only one function, i.e ***single responsibility*** as described in [S.O.L.I.D] principle. .
* Provide code re-usability
* Testable business logic via Unit Tests.

## The app has following packages 
1. **data**: It contains sources and domain repository implementation.
2. **domain**: It contains models and defines data repository.
3. **ui**: View classes along with their corresponding ViewModel and Adapters.
4. **utils**: Utility classes.
